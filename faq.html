                                      Introducing our newest Techy Senior: Mrs. Cheryl Budd! Recently, she and her husband faced significant challenges after being hacked, prompting them to seek our support. During a call, we successfully troubleshooted the issues, including preventing unauthorized access to their computer and ensuring it was free of viruses. In these times, scams and hackers are increasingly prevalent, so we urge everyone to be cautious about what they click on. We are grateful to Mrs. Budd for trusting us to assist her, and we warmly welcome her to the Techy Seniors family!

                                       Introducing the latest addition to our Techy Seniors community – Mr. Larry Dinkin. We had the pleasure of assisting Mr. Dinkin with his desktop computer, which had encountered some technical issues. Despite his remote work situation in New York, he was unable to resolve the problem on his own. So, we took the initiative to visit his residence and provide a solution.
In addition to repairing his computer, we had the delightful opportunity to guide him through the process of sending us a video. We patiently walked him through the intricacies of using WhatsApp and sending a video via the platform.
We extend our sincere gratitude to Mr. Dinkin for entrusting us with his technical needs and warmly welcome him to our ever-growing Techy family.

                                       In a recent home visit with our esteemed Techy Senior, Ms. Patricia Henry, we addressed a printer malfunction characterized by sheets not feeding properly and disintegrating during printing attempts. At first she aspired to buy a new printer, but called on us to give a look beforehand. Through meticulous examination and troubleshooting, we identified an unexpected obstruction: a lodged pill inside the printer. Overcoming this challenge required employing various methods to safely remove the pill without damaging the printer. On top of her saving money, the printer is now fully operational, demonstrating our commitment to resolving technical issues for seniors free of charge! We extend our gratitude to Ms. Henry for entrusting us with this task and for being an integral part of our tech-savvy community.

                                       Introducing our latest addition to the Techy Senior team, Ms. Patricia Henry. During our recent in-home visit, we successfully addressed three important issues. Our first task was to assist Ms. Henry in accessing the photos on her phone via her computer. We presented two methods, namely direct transfer using her phone and the preferred method we employed, Google Photos. By guiding her through the steps of accessing Google Photos, we ensured that she can now retrieve her photos anytime, hassle-free.<br><br>

The next challenge was to help Ms. Henry access her email. To overcome this hurdle, we demonstrated how to access her email through her preferred web browser. We tackled the issue systematically, enabling her to effortlessly manage her email account.<br><br>

The final issue we resolved was related to Doordash, where the app failed to function. Upon investigation, we discovered that the app required an update. We promptly updated the app and ensured that all other apps requiring updates were also addressed, thereby averting any potential future problems. As an additional assistance, we ensured that photos received via WhatsApp no longer automatically save to her camera roll.<br><br>

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Patricia Henry for allowing us the opportunity to assist her. On behalf of the Techy Senior Family, we wholeheartedly welcome her to our community of tech-savvy individuals.

During today's session, I had the privilege of assisting her in seamlessly transferring photos from her phone to her external drive. As part of our comprehensive support, we also provided her with valuable insights into the advantages of utilizing Google services such as Google Drive and Gmail. Furthermore, we guided her on accessing her photos on her computer through iCloud, as well as effectively navigating her computer's file explorer to explore various functions. We requested her to send a 20 second or less video of her experience. She provided a video of how her experience was even saying “20 seconds is not enough time to explain and show appreciation for what you did🤗” We extend our gratitude to Ms. Yvonne for granting us the opportunity to assist her and for becoming a cherished member of our Techy family.

Introducing Ms. Yvonne Facey, our esteemed recipient of the second computer in our program. During the session, we provided her with a comprehensive overview of the laptop's fundamental functionalities, including powering it on, connecting it to a power source, and accessing essential applications such as internet browsing and Gmail for managing her emails. Additionally, we assisted her in creating a new Google account, ensuring she can easily access it in the future. To further ensure her convenience, we promptly shared the account details with her via text message, enabling her to securely retain this information. We express our sincere gratitude to Ms. Yvonne Facey for granting us the opportunity to assist her and extend a warm welcome to her as a valued member of the Techy family.

                                     Meet Ms. Jennifer Rainford, the proud recipient of one of our three coveted laptops being given away. Ms. Rainford's laptop will serve as a valuable tool in her pursuit of writing her book, a passion project she holds dear to her heart.<br><br>

During our recent session, we had the privilege of guiding Ms. Rainford through the laptop's functionalities, acquainting her with the various tools at her disposal. Among these, we placed special emphasis on introducing her to the wonders of Google Docs—a cutting-edge, cloud-based word processing solution. We took the time to explain why Google Docs is the preferred choice over traditional software like Microsoft Word. With its seamless accessibility across devices and real-time collaboration features, Google Docs empowers writers like Ms. Rainford to work efficiently and effortlessly.<br><br>

One feature that particularly resonated with Ms. Rainford was the remarkable voice-to-text functionality, a game-changer for her writing process. By simply speaking her thoughts aloud, the laptop transcribes her words into text, eliminating the need for manual typing. This invaluable tool enables Ms. Rainford to capture her creativity swiftly and fluidly, allowing her ideas to flow effortlessly onto the digital page.<br><br>

An official presentation will be done on Sunday where she will also be giving her statement! On behalf of the entire Techy family, we extend a warm welcome to Ms. Jennifer Rainford. We are honored to have her as a valued member of our community, and we eagerly await the extraordinary accomplishments she will undoubtedly achieve with her new laptop. Together, we will support her every step of the way as she brings her book to life and leaves an indelible mark on the literary world.<br><br>

Welcome to the Techy family!

During our in-home visit, we had the privilege of guiding her through the intricacies of her Chromebook.
